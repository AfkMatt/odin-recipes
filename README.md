# odin-recipes
Hello future Matt. Today (Nov 27th, 2021) you'll be coding together a recipes list from TOP (The Odin Project). Learning HTML basics which include setting up HTML Document, uploading to GITHUB, using GIT. Further more you'll also be implementing basic HTML structure such as, lists, links, images, and paragraph set up. Enjoy!

You'll also be spicing up this page with newly learned CSS work! sounds fun!
